# Readme

This project is practice, for me to learn using Ruby with Sinatra to build a simple API.

The assignment that I'm following is described in [`ASSIGNMENT.md`](ASSIGNMENT.md). 

## How It Works
The project is implemented using the [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/), a domain-specific language 
created for Ruby, to allow people to create web applications quickly. For the datastore, I'm using
SQLite. I also do automated testing using RSpec.

## How to Install
* Clone Git repo
* Run `bundle install`

## How to Run
